# Phishing Email Detection Project

## Overview
This project implements a phishing email detection system using email sender address, subject, and body content. It includes:

The dataset is taken from CEAS and includes both phishing and legit emails and are real phishing emails pulled from people. I got this data set from Kaggle and it has over 30k data points.

## Setup
Download all of the dependencies that are listed in the requirements.txt.
Run the ML.ipynb from top to bottom in order

## Key findings
Using the Random Forest Tree we were able to obtain an accuracy score of 99% accuracy. This is significantly better than the 
baseline model which had an accuracy score of around 55% by using the majority class specification. We used the length of the subject, length of the body, and key words found in the body to classify the email as phishing or legit. The shallow learning technique worked extremely well.
